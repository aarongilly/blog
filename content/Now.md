I am currently working on these things... 
Last affirmed **2024-10-05**.

## Living
First things first, enjoying the prime of my life.

## PDW 2.0
The Personal Data Warehouse is undergoing a large codebase refactor. Messing with Obsidian-as-a-PDW made me want to redo the PDW altogether.

## Obsidian as a PDW
I have my [[PDW]] framework, which I’ve realized recently that Obsidian could definitely fit into. If I can figure out mass import & export to my [[PDW#Data Structure]] then I will migrate from my cloud-first approach to a local one.

A(Canonical Data Structure)
B(Obsidian-native files)

# On Deck / On Hold

## Semantic Canvas v1.2
Adding lots of neat-but-obvious features that will make the [[Semantic Canvas]] plugin more useful.
