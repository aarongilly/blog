## Me
I’m Aaron Gillespie. I’m the tall guy in that picture down there. This website is my internet-facing presence. I maintain it for fun and to keep myself producing [[Creations Catalog|creative content]]. I’m a married father of two. I am an Electrical Engineer by education, but have spent more energy learning to code and build things since my graduation from college. I’m an advocate of self-tracking, making life fun, and getting things done.

## This Website
Written by [[#Me]], primarily to host [[#The Column]], but also to serve as my “main” presence on the web[^1] & host some other things (e.g. [[Tools I Use]] & [[Now]]).  
### The Column
![[home-feature-column.png]]
“The Column” is my blog. It is the headlining feature of this website. It has existed in one form or another for most of the past two decades, from a “The Column” section of the Xanga page for a band the I was in for 3 weeks in middle school, to a WordPress page hosted by a friend, to a Tumblr right after college, to Blogger past 7 years, and now on GitHub Pages. I write the Column because I enjoy writing. If you enjoy any portion of reading it, that’s a happy side effect. Columns cover whatever topic I feel like writing about at the time. As such, their content is usually contemporaneous to the time and always informal.
### Creations
![[home-feature-creations.png]]

I like to make things. Sometimes I forget things I've made. The [[Creations Catalog]] page is meant to be a catalog of some of the stuff I've made over the years. 
### Now
My [[Now]] page is a [now page](https://sive.rs/nowff).
### Tools I Use
[[Tools I Use|Here's what I use to do things]].
## My Other Things
This is not my only website.
### Gillespedia
![[home-feature-notes.png]]
[Gillespedia](https://gillespedia.com) is a public-facing version of [my notes](https://gillespedia.com/My+Notes). It's a cache of >1500 [evergreen](https://gillespedia.com/Evergreen+Notes) and [atomic](https://gillespedia.com/Atomic+Notes) notes in an [Obsidian](https://gillespedia.com/Obsidian)-based [slip-box](https://gillespedia.com/Slip-Box+Method). 

Similar to this website, everything there is written by me using Obsidian. Unlike this blog (which uses [Quartz publishing](https://gillespedia.com/Quartz+Publishing), lightly modified), I'm using Obsidian's native publish method for Gillespedia.
### Aaron’s Puzzles
![[home-feature-puzzles.png]]
I make cyber-physical puzzle boxes, hosted [here](https://aaronspuzzles.com). At a cadence of one-per year. This year's puzzle box is [[Brief Mystery]].
### Personal Data Warehouse
![[home-feature-pdw.png]]

I built a framework (released as [an NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdw)) to build a system for storing personal event-based data. I use this every day for tracking things like sleep, workouts, and quotes. Read more [[PDW|here]].
### We Scene a Movie
![[home-feature-podcast.png]]
I have [a movie-based podcast](https://shows.acast.com/we-scene-a-movie). We're bad, but it's fun to make. We're available wherever you get your podcasts. We also only put out episodes every few weeks or so - not much of a commitment. Look at me selling so effectively.
