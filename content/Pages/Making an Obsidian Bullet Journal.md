Obsidian is an app [[408#1. .txt|I first wrote about in May 2021]] primarily for note taking & personal knowledge management, but can be used in many other ways. Bullet Journals I covered in [[460|Column #460]]. This page describes how I build a system approximating a **digital bullet journal** using Obsidian, some plugins, some Siri Shortcuts, my [[PDW]], and some elbow grease.
## Results
This whole thing will look complicated, and setting it up was... but **using** it is as fast and easy as possible.
## Obsidian + PDW = Success?
I'm actively in the process of migrating my [[PDW]] to an Obsidian-based system. Like all PDW-related stuff since the epoch of v10, this does not mean abandoning old codebases. The [[PDW#Canonical Data Structure]] will remain intact, but translations via an Obsidian DataStore Connector will make it feel native to Obsidian.
