Obsidian is an app [[408#1. .txt|I first wrote about in May 2021]] primarily for note taking & personal knowledge management, but can be used in many other ways. Bullet Journals I covered in [[460|Column #460]]. This page describes how I build a system approximating a **digital bullet journal** using Obsidian, some plugins, some Siri Shortcuts, my [[PDW]], and some elbow grease.
## Results
This whole thing will get complicated. So much so, 
### Obsidian + PDW = Success?
