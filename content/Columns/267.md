Motto: I'm the Guy in the Suit

  
This post was written more for me than usual. Proceed with caution and/or boredom.  
  
Most of my writing lately has funneled into the MCU Feature. I didn't make that a link, because what's on this site doesn't reflect the current state of the Feature. I don't like Blogger's text editor for advanced formatting. I want my Features to be formatted nicely, sort of a showcase of "I _could_ be doing _this_ every time". So I'm writing the Feature elsewhere, and will hopefully figure out a way to display it on this site that maintains my formatting.  
  
Hopefully.  
  
It's October. [Traditionally, October has been my bulk month](http://www.aarongilly.com/215l), but I am taking bulk off this year for a couple of reasons:  
  
1. I don't have access to a gym with a proper squat rack or bench press. Bulking without lifting heavy is just called "getting fat". So I'm not doing that.
2. I am in two basketball leagues, playing at least two games a week. It's come to my attention that I could use some cardio love. Bulking runs counter to that end.

The 30 Day Challenge for this month will instead be "**break a sweat 5 days a week**". That should be nice and easy without being _too_ nice and easy. I very badly need to get back on top of my health game. So this covers that.  
  
In my writing of the MCU Feature, I've been rewatching the series. I still pull out new things from these movies... not saying they are super deep or anything - I'm just saying that almost every movie usually has a few things you can't pick up without repeated viewings. I've fully changed my opinion about a few details from these movies because I've picked up new things this time around.  
  
I babysit my niece and nephew. Kids are getting less scary... but that brings them from "the scariest thing I can think of" levels to "less scary than 'The Ring', but still way up there" levels.

Top 5: Things that Happened in 2008

5\. Christopher Nolan's "[The Dark Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FDark%5FKnight%5F%28film%29)" comes out. It blows away everyone's expectations, but doesn't earn the top-scoring "superhero movie" spot on this list.  
4\. I switched majors from Film Studies to (journalism, then computer science, then computer engineering, then...) Electrical Engineering  
3\. HTC came out with the ["HTC Dream"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC%5FDream), the first ever Android device  
2\. Marvel came out with [Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel%5FCinematic%5FUniverse), marking the start of the Marvel Cinematic Universe  
1\. The University of Kansas won the [Orange Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%5FOrange%5FBowl) (football) and the [National Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%5FNCAA%5FMen%27s%5FDivision%5FI%5FBasketball%5FTournament) (men's basketball)
