I have been hard at work during this forced shut-in. Every minute I'm not with my wife and son, nor sleeping, nor eating, nor practicing guitar, nor working from home, nor doing standard chores[^one], I have been building a new system of permanent notes. 

This post is 100% about that. So bail out now if you're not interested.

# Why

It's been my ambition to never let what's important to me fall by the wayside. In a coincidence of events, one of those things I've deemed important *also* helps me arm myself with the tools and techniques to handle all the other things: **managing my knowledge**. 

When I graduated college I realized if I wasn't careful I would have already achieved my maximum level of knowledge. I was fresh off classes like *Partial Differential Equations* and *Electromagnetic Interference*. I didn't want to reach 45 and realize I was dumber than I was at 25. I set out to review & summarize everything I ever learned into a sort of pseudo study guide for every class ever. As I wrote about in [my previous post](https://aarongilly.com/389), I ultimately gave up on the idea (after doing a 50+ page outline, in fairness to myself).

Recently I've been reading a lot of books (again, wholly thanks to [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/), [Axis 360](http://axis360.site.baker-taylor.com/), & [RbDigital](https://rbdigital.com/), and taking lots of notes. Each book had its own little summary page. Somewhere in the middle of my 24th book summary, I realized the the notes I was writing for *this* book that were incredibly similar to notes I'd previously written for other books... and that was happening a **lot**.

Enter [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y/).[^two] It changed my goal. I didn't want a bunch of independent book summaries - I wanted *smart notes*.

# What

"Smart Notes" is a much less German term for the *Zettelkasten Notetaking Method*. In short, the Smart Notes system consists of a few basic concepts.

1. Atomic Notes - short notes that cover only one idea
2. Unique IDs - all notes are uniquely identified
3. Linked Notes - notes reference other notes by their IDs
4. Basic Tagging - notes are tagged with relevant topics or themes
5. No organizational hierarchy

The end result is a mass of small notes, linked together in a network via their natural relations to one-another... very much like how ideas work in your head. You keep this repository active, and add to it incrementally for the rest of your life.

# How

First, I gathered all my book summaries. Then, I jotted down a short list of (literally four) online articles that I've found very insightful. After humming and hawwing for literally 3+ months, I decided on an implementation strategy. It's based in Notion.

I am utilizing two linked Databases in Notion: one for **Sources** and one for **Notes**.

## Sources

My sources database contains book summaries, article summaries, names of & links to podcasts, and names of individual people. It does NOT contain "clippings" or any wholesale copy/paste content. This choice was made partially to prevent possible future plagiarization, but moreso because when I *did* have other people's writing in there all my searches for stuff I knew I'd written were returning results written by other people. It made the whole process of rediscovering what I already knew more difficult.

![[390-2.png]]

The sources each have properties for type (book/podcast/article/person), a relevant URL, a status (reading/atomized), a relation property to the Notes database for all the notes that source generated, then a rollup property counting the notes in the relation.

## Notes

My notes database has properties for tags (multiselect), source (Linked database to "Sources"), created (auto date), updated (auto date), a summary, and a "to do" checkbox. I'm not utilizing some sort of "UID" property, because their URL functions that way. Instead my notes are named with a few keywords describing them - such as "Known/Unknown Matrix" or "Naturals vs Strivers". 

![[390-3.png]]

The notes themselves are, thus far, a few paragraphs long each (on average). I utilize callouts, colors, bolding, italicizing, images, @mentions, and "links to page". I have a template that gives me a place to write the note, a horizontal rule, then a H1 header for "Related Notes". Under that header I'll manually create a series of "Link to Page" for any related notes. I also utilize @mention page links in the body of the note when I reference the concepts covered by that note (part of the reason why naming the notes something lexically useful is beneficial).

## A Final Note on How

Here is my [Notes database](https://www.notion.so/a7627b8ed78b4eab9e31364cb7b98eea?v=c957bb0ea6dd42e9a83df8338e11c786) and [Sources](https://www.notion.so/e301531cc1ee4ad7ae537d87f9681116?v=2136c19212174a24956154a130b78b1b) - if you really see how it's working. I intend to leave it open for viewing by anyone interested. I'm the the method isn't [perfect](https://www.notion.so/Perfection-is-Dangerous-ee2d6db59fef4d359e791c72328bbce5). It could be improved upon, but seems to be working well enough for me. I can open & search the entire thing from my phone or any browser. 

I can export the entire database to a .CSV with all my properties and individual markdown files whose links to other notes still function. Both methods of linking, @ links and "Links to Page", produce relative links that I can traverse between in VS Code. Images are stored in a folder per page, and in properly exclamation-mark-linked as you'd expect in Markdown. Those, too, can be traversed via clicking in VS Code (and, presumably, other tools more squarely aimed at creating a Zettelkasten).

# The Result - My Work in Progress

![[390-4.png]]

I finished atomizing all 24 of my book summaries over the course of about 12 days. I read my own summaries, broke them apart into their constituent components, and created Notes for those components. As I went, I linked new Notes to notes I'd already taken. Sometimes I'd go back to a note I'd already taken and add more to it, to cover information from a different source on the same topic. Concepts like how "Routine Frees the Mind" and the benefits of "Being Unavailable" were well-covered by multiple sources.

## The Numbers

These are all going to change *immediately*. This is a living database. Here's a snapshot circa this post.

![[390-6.png]]

I have **270** notes.  
Currently I have **19** categories.  
I've tagged notes 550 times, which means each note has **two** tags on average (not an important stat, but it was free).  

My two highest categories are **philosophy** and **productivity**. I've got >100 notes on both of those. The third highest category, **business** has less than 50. I guess I'm specializing in the philosophy of productivity.

![[390-7.png]]

In that chart, blue = books, orange = articles, and grey is for *other*.

The most-cited (i.e. most impactful?) books I've read are *Essentialism* and *Atomic Habits*. There's a bit of recency bias with *Essentialism* and the 3rd most-cited book *Stillness is the Key*. They are both very good, but also helped out by the fact that I was actively doing this project while reading them.

I wanted to do a network diagram to display how the notes were linked, but I don't really have the means to produce such a diagram without doing an amount of work that, frankly, I'm too tired to do. I'll figure that out someday, then put it on here in whatever post.

In other news - I'm bringing color back to my Top 5s & Quotes.
