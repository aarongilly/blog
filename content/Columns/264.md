Motto: Knowledge = Voltage × Current! 

  
This column is going to be fun, but first you've got to earn that fun through some learning. I'm going to start this post off with a lesson about one of the most useful-in-the-real-world mathematical concepts I ever learned. Today, we're going to look at **dimensional analysis**.   
  
The word "dimension" has several different definitions. When it comes to math and science, I tend to think of "dimensions" as all the independent variables of a problem. In other words, all of the things you can change without changing anything else.   
  
**Easy example:** Longitude, Latitude, Altitude   
You if you're on an elevator, you're changing your altitude without changing your longitude and altitude. Altitude is a different dimension than the other two. Similarly, you could walk directly towards the North Pole and change your latitude without changing your longitude. These are _dimensions_.   
  
Dimensions are measured in _units_. Engineering (or, perhaps, science in general) is math + units. When you introduce units into math, you transcend the abstract. 3 bananas + 2 bananas = 5 bananas. I like that better than 3 + 2 = 5\. Often times, in real world problems, you can utilize units to direct your math.   
  
**You travel 100 miles 5 hours. What was your average speed?**  
  
Speed is length divided by time (meters/seconds or miles/hours).   
So, to figure out speed, we see that we have to divide miles by hours. 100 {miles} / 5 {hours} = 20 {miles/hour}.   
  
But what if the question was this:   
**You travel 528000 feet in 300 minutes. What was your average speed?**  
  
Well, it's technically a correct answer to say 528000 {feet} / 300 {minutes} = 1760 {feet/minute}... but that's not really useful. We want to get our answer in units we can _understand_.   
  
We can get around this by utilizing a trivial mathematical concept, applied in a clever way.   
  
**These two things are true, regardless of what "A" is:**  
A × 1 = A   
and   
A / A = 1   
  
You can multiply _anything_ by 1, and still have that thing. You can divide _anything_ by itself and get 1\.   
  
Here's the tricky part:   
60 {minutes} = 1 {hour}   
and   
5280 {feet} = 1 {mile}   
  
Thus:   
(60 {minutes} / 1 {hour}) = 1   
and   
(1 {mile} / 5280 {feet}) = 1   
  
So, you can multiply _anything_ by (60 {minutes} / 1 {hour}) and still get that thing (just expressed in terms of new units). You can do the same thing with (1 {mile} / 5280 {feet}).   
  
Applying this A × 1 = A concept, utilizing the fact that (60 {minutes} / 1 {hour}) = (5280 {feet} / 1 {mile}) = 1, we can can solve our problem:   
  
(1760 {feet/minute}) × 1 × 1   
\= (1760 {feet/minute}) × (60 {minutes} / 1 {hour}) × (1 {mile} / 5280 {feet})   
\= (1760 × 60 {feet × minutes × miles}) / (5280 {minutes × hours × feet})   
\= (105600 {~~feet~~ × ~~minutes~~ × miles}) / (5280 {~~minutes~~ × hours × ~~feet~~})   
**\= 20 {miles/hour}**  
  
Dimensional analysis is basically just the process of making the units work out (or, checking if your process ends with the correct units). You convert units by cleverly mulitplying by 1 many times in many ways. You can extend this concept into much more difficult problems.   
  
If the first question was so simple you just said "well this isn't useful, I could just do that in my head". Then this harder is for you:   
  
**If a person drinks X liters of water per day, and you have Y people stranded on an island, for how many weeks (Z) can the people stay hydrated on the island (in terms of X & Y)?**  
  
We have X, measured in {liters/(days × persons)} and Y, measured in {persons}. We need Z, measured in {weeks}. We know 1 week = 7 days, so we can do unit conversion easily.   
  
**Z {weeks} = 1/7XY {liters/(day\*persons)} 7 {days/week} × Y {persons} = 7XYZ {liters}**  
  
In school and in real life I have done tons of things like this. You'll see some fake/fun examples in a second.

Here is some fun with dimensional analysis:   
  
**House of Cards:**

  
* I estimate that 1 out of every 8 houses in the United States has a deck.
* There are 52 cards in a standard deck.
   * 1 {deck} / 8 {houses} × 52 {cards} / 1 {deck} = 6.5 {cards/house}
* Thus - **a house of cards must be made from an average of 6.5 cards.**
  
This is hard. I'm going to do one more and get over it. I've tried SEVERAL (see the Top 5) that haven't worked out so well.

  
This one is a little more strict - this equality does actually work mathematically - even if it's meaningless:

* [Dietary calories in a Taco Bell bean burrito](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=21264): 386 calories
* [Speed limit on the Kansan interstates](http://www.kansas.com/news/local/article1067157.html): 75 miles per hour
* [Average human height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo%5Fsapiens): 66 inches
* [Fastest "healthy" weight loss](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047752): 1.5 pounds per week
   * [386 dietary calories / (75 miles per hour \* 66 inches \* 1.5 lbs/week) = 2.55×10^10](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=386+dietary+calories+%2F+%2875+miles+per+hour+%2A+66+inches+%2A+1.5+lbs%2Fweek%29)
* Calories in a Taco Bell bean burrito / (speed limit on the Kansan interstates × average human height × fastest 'healthy' weight loss) \~= [1/4 the total population of all humans who've ever lived](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2.55%C3%9710%5E10&lk=1&a=ClashPrefs%5F%2AMath-%27).

For this post I took great inspiration from the author of XKCD, who [has basically done a more accurate version of this exact same thing before](https://xkcd.com/687/):

5\. Dollars/mouth (saw blades/tooth × $/blade movies × teeth/mouth)  
4\. Bacon packs/pizza (bacon packs/slices × slices/pizza)  
3\. Artists/cave (hits/artist × bats/hits × cave/bats)  
2\. Chassis/bankruptcy wedges (chassis/blade × blades/fusion × fusion/wheels × Wheel of Fortune wheel/bankruptcy wedges)
