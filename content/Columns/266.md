Motto: Simply Perfect

  
I am writing whole piece this using only the ten hundred most often used words. I am doing this because [a guy whose work I enjoy](http://xkcd.com/about/) did this, which you can see by [pressing these words](http://xkcd.com/1133/). I am using [this thing](http://blog.xkcd.com/2015/09/22/a-thing-explainer-word-checker/) [he made](http://blog.xkcd.com/2015/09/22/a-thing-explainer-word-checker/) to check my work.  
  
This week is a big week for me. A company I really like put out [their newest phones](https://store.google.com/). A different company I really like is BOTH coming out with more of [their television show](http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agents-of-shield) AND [their movie](http://movies.disney.com/marvels-avengers-age-of-ultron) to buy that you could not get until now. An [short movie maker](https://www.youtube.com/user/screenjunkies) made a short movie about the movie I am excited to buy. [Touch here to see that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeDJAKvcZ9o). Last, [a different movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/) is coming out that my wife and I both want to watch. We read [the book from which this movie came](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FMartian%5F%28Weir%5Fnovel%29) last month. It was very good so we expect the movie to also be very good. I am excited for these things, and other things coming soon.  
  
I ordered the larger phone. It comes in six weeks. It has many things I am excited for:   
* The camera that has larger light gathering spots so more light comes in for your photos.
* A camera that is faster than before and it takes bigger photos (because it has more light spots).
* The phone should live for longer between powering times.
* The larger screen that can light up some parts while not lighting up other parts if it wants to.
* The new running system that does new and cool things.
* Much like my wife's phone:
   * The outside of it is made of metal and not plastic.
   * It looks at your finger to know who you are.
   * The flash has two colors to make pictures look better.
   * It's bigger than my old one.
   * It can make slow movies.
   * It can make big movies.
   * It has more space to save stuff.
* There are two speakers, and they are on the front of the phone.
* There is a new power line that works both ways and works faster.
* It looks like this:

That black bar on the back is strange, but I will get used to it. I am already used to it. I now like the black bar.  
  
Writing like this is actually really fun. I wouldn't want to do it all the time, but it really makes you think about what you are saying. I have a problem where sometimes I say things or ask questions that don't really get the information that I want to get. If I want to know whether or not I should take a plate from the table for someone I ask "do you want more food?", when instead I should ask "do you want me to take that plate?".   
  
Just now, I used a thing I learned a short time ago to figure out what words I can say by looking in a special way at this page. I can see all the words at once. Most people wouldn't know how to do what I just did. That made me feel cool for a second.  
  
I very much enjoyed writing this.

"You said 'wet farts'."

\- Krista. Side note: You have to give me a pass on the words "farts" and "Krista". They do not fit in line with this way of writing. -
