Motto: Now I'm thinki0 0ng with Portals.

So. It's been a week since my last post. Why the semi-unusually long break between posts?  
  
That's what happens when I accidentally reset my entire computing architecture to zero then spend all my spare time learning how to operate on Linux, learning what's possible, and making myself a new computer home. My old laptop, running a new OS, is now capable of video editing, photo editing, Android development, media streaming/backup, and videogaming. I set up those 5 things over the past 7 days. They are all free; and they all work just fine. In fact, I'm much more fond of my computer now than I was about 10 days ago when it ran the Windows setup I'd built out over the past 8 years.  
  
I realized I'm not going to miss Windows 7\.   
  
I _also_ realized that my Playstation 3 is entirely unnecessary.   
  
My laptop is very much capable of playing games. Steam is cool. Games are easier to get, cheaper, and everything runs off a common platform. I was able to get Portal 1 up and running without much/any hassle. Portal is a ridiculously fun game that everyone should play. It's funny, smart, and incredibly unique. Just watch this:  
  
  
I played through Portal 2 something like 2 years ago. Loved it. Wanted to play Portal 1, but it was a computer-only game. So, when I had access to a computer-based gaming system it was naturally my first choice. Portal came out in 2008 and I just played through it. There's a very very relevant XKCD for this situation:

So, back to my point, I do not play videogames often enough any more to really justify the Playstation. So, if anyone is looking to buy a PS3\. I guess I'm selling.

Top 5: Things You Could Do This Weekend with Your Computer and Zero Dollars

5\. Install a new, Linux-based Operating System. I chose [Ubuntu 14.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop).  
4\. Install the free version of [Lightworks](http://www.lwks.com/) to start video editing and [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) to start photo editing.   
3\. Install the [MakeMKV beta](http://makemkv.com/) & [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/) to rip your DVD/Bluray collection. Install [Plex](https://plex.tv/) to stream it throughout your network.

1\. Install the [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) beta to start developing for the world's most used Operating System.
