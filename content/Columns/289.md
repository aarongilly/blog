Motto: I Write for Posterity  
  
Three posts in three days! I'm on a _roll_... possibly because I'm out of my routine so fully that writing has supplanted otherwise healthy tasks like cleaning and/or exercising. Note this post is crazy-long, but hopefully more entertaining than usual. I had a good time writing it.  
  
This post is a part deux. Part un happened on 11/11/2014 in [Post #219](http://www.aarongilly.com/219).   
  
I have had a Moleskine notebook for over 3 years that I've written in here or there. I started looking through it tonight and realized what I've written in there is 7 to 7.128 times better than the stuff I write on here... and my first post a year a half ago didn't cover hardly any of it. WITHOUT FURTHER DUDES, LET'S BEGIN!

This morning I thought to myself "I wish I wrote poetry that was more open to interpretation". Then I thought, "that was a very civilized & refined thing for me to think".   
I am a damn GENIUS

An incomplete list of things I like:

This list was doomed before it began. I'm going to reclaim this page. HE'S GOING THE DISTANCE. HE'S GOING FOR SPEED.

Super powers.

General Healthiness & Happiness Inequality  
Quantity A:  
(Pleasure of being fit) - (displeasure of eating healthy) - (displeasure of exercise)  
  
Quantity B:  
(pleasure of eating anything) + (pleasure of being lazy) - (displeasure of being fat)  
  
Which do you believe?  
Quantity A > Quantity B  
Quantity A < Quantity B  
Quantity A = Quantity B  
  
If A > B -> Get fit!  
If A < B -> Get fat!  
If A = B -> Tough call!

Why is there not "total life solution?" Just a series of products and services that make the tasks that everyone performs (or should perform) easier?   
Finance tracking & budgeting that automatically looks for tax-related items and reminds you of them come tax time - also automatically adds large purchases to an inventory for insurance purposes... and looks up warranty information and notifies you when your products are about to go out of warranty.

Another list of life tips:

Take all your goals, let's say you've accomplished them. What does your life look like now? What do you do every day? Week? Month?  
  
For me... I'd be efficiently busy all the time. Downtime isn't wasted. I'd read. I'd do puzzles. I'd learn how to do _(stuff)_. I'd exercise and appropriate amount & eat appropriate foods. I'd probably do meal prep. I would dress well. See friends just often enough. I would be able to code anything I want. I would support my wife. I would be in total control of my own body. I would write, but wouldn't talk as much. I would listen better.  
  
_(I left this one last on purpose. It's your homework. What would your life look like?)_
