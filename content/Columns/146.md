Motto: The Times, They are a Changing

  
September 2012 I started my first real job. I entered into an engineering technical development rotation program. For the past year and a half, I've driven around inspecting telecommunications equipment in offices scattered throughout the Midwest. I enjoyed the work. I enjoyed the work - and I was good at it. I gained a high level understand of what makes our cell phones and the internet tick. I learned how a data center should look, and how it shouldn't. I learned a lot and had the pleasure of working with a ton of great people. It was my first real job and I'll always remember it fondly.

  
The thing about rotation programs is this: your job is to change jobs. Monday morning that's exactly what I did. I woke up this morning with my game face on.

I rotated into a new job role, in a new city (sort of). While I can't say exactly what the challenges I will be facing are, I can say they will be infinitely different from those that I'm used to. It's going to be a wild and crazy ride.

  
And I'm ready for it.

  
Top 5: Internet memes I'm going to use to apply to my new rotation

5\. Yo dawg, I heard you like jobs, so we put different jobs in your job so you can do jobs while you're doing your job!  
4\. Alright, let's do this. LEEROY JENKINS!  
3\. I can has new leadership roles? (I hate this meme)  
2\. Such new position. Much responsibility. Wow.  

1\. I apologize for this entire Top 5.
