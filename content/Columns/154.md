Motto: The Point of this Post is to Make You Hate Me

  
It was St. Patrick's day yesterday, and I think that's the one day of the year we all like to gather and give thanks. I recognize that I have a ton to be thankful for, seriously. The following is a non-exhaustive list of advantages with which I've been blessed:

* I grew up in a household with both my parents. The whole upbringing turned out to be a sneaky way to teach me how to be part of a successful and happy relationship.
* I was the youngest kid in the family... by several years. I learned how to schmooze people, but I also learned how to be independent. Also, my two older sisters absorbed most of the parental worries. I totally had it easy.
* I am a white male. This shouldn't be an advantage in today's society, but it's part of the way people approach me and has surely affected the opportunities I've had.
* I'm between 6'8" and 6'9" and possess at least a small amount of natural athleticism.
* I have this face:

* I graduated college with a degree in a highly marketable, very well respected field.
* I have a fantastic set of friends. They are the best people in the world and that's why I'm friends with them. I'm lucky I found a way to make them stuck with me.
* I'm engaged to the most beautiful, wonderful, and impressive person I've ever met.
* Lastly: I live in a world with Google and Marvel movies.

Google just blew the lid off the wearable technospace. That word I just made up shouldn't distract you from just how important Google's announcement was today.  
  
Android Wear is soon going to be a thing... and it looks fantastic.
