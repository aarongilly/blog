Editor's Note 1: This post is sort of a follow-on to Columns [#291](https://aarongilly.com/291) and [#333](https://aarongilly.com/333/), in which I wrote about "unsexy solutions" to some of life's most widely-faced challenges. 

Editor's Note 2: Both of the links from Editor's Note 1 are broken right now because I'm in the middle of retroactively "fixing" all my old Columns. Eventually both of those links will work. I'm leaving it for now as incentive for me to finish that project.

# The Index Card

Back in 2013, while promoting her new book, author Helaine Olen said:

> The best [financial] advice for most people would fit on an index card - Helaine Olen[^1]

When asked what such an index card would look like, Helaine whipped out a pen, a card, hastily took a picture of it, and produced a viral image:

I **love** this concept. 

This is an application of the [Pareto Principle](https://aarongilly.com/gillespedia/pareto-principle/) to an entire body of knowledge. Personal finance is, much to my frustration, an **incredibly** opaque and deep topic. There are volumes and volumes of in-depth analyses of the field from all sorts of sources. There are websites, books, courses, videos, and a whole industry of professional advisors to explain the subject. If you're a layperson, just getting started is intimidating. For some, too intimidating to even entertain the concept. They just accept their ignorance and hope whatever they're doing by default is "good enough".

For those that do attempt to educate themselves, they walk into a familiar situation. Any given article or book will assume the reader has a particular amount of pre-existing knowledge. As the reader, it's difficult to predict which resources will be "at your level". So you dip your toe in, you find words like "equity" and "annuity" and then you either double-down on researching or *nope* right out of there.

Even if you push past that, you're typically reading in great detail about the bark on a particular tree, when what you really need is to see the layout of the forest. You've got a dozen or more tabs open of things you've run across and decided you need to read more about, after you've figured out what this article is all about.

Enter "**The Index Card**"... 

Yes, it doesn't take into account edge case situations; and, yes, it's a rudimentary. **That's the point**, though. For 80% of people, this tiny set of advice is enough to take them from "completely ignorant" to "just *mostly* ignorant" - but with enough knowledge to *probably* make the right decisions by default. It's not even an 80/20 situation, it's better than that. It's more like 80/1 *(~80% of people can benefit from 1% of the advice or knowledge available)*.

## Other Index Card(s)

Personal finance is by no means a unique field. There are many such high-barrier-to-entry bodies of knowledge, with best practices that are known & generally agreed upon by experts in the field, about which people could benefit from a basic, easily consumable set of no-prerequisite-knowledge-needed advice. Something as simple as an index card. 

So here goes.

**NOTE:** I am not a trained/certified expert at ANY of these things. Proceed with caution.

If you use an advisor, make them commit to a fiduciary standard.  
Buy a home when you're ready to stay for ~5+ years.

 If you're always unhappy and dissatisfied, seek help.
