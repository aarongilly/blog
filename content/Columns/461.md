I've spent the past few Columns going hyper-specific on stuff. This one will be more diffuse in focus. Aka perhaps more interesting.
# Principles
I am currently reading "Principles" by Ray Dalio. It's not *introduced* the concept of principles to me, but has me thinking about them. In particular I'm revisiting my [[General Operating Principles]]. That list is worth a gander[^0] if you're at all interested, but the TL;DR of the top-level principles is the Top 5, below.
# Words
It's funny to me me how some words mean different and seemingly totally random things.
## Examples
> [!example] Gauntlet
> 1. A glove thing
> 2. A series of challenges

> [!example] Spring
> 1. A metal coil
> 2. A small stream of water
> 3. Set free from capture

> [!example] Match
> 1. A little fire starting thing
> 2. A particular instance of competition
> 3. Descriptor of two things that are alike

> [!example] Lint
> 1. Little bits of fabric that fall off
> 2. An automation that ensures text-based content adheres to stylistic standards

> [!example] Gander
> 1. Look at
> 2. Male goose
# Tall
I've not spoken with someone taller than me in the past 5+ years. The last time I remember talking with someone taller than me was in 2018. Fun fact.
# Recent Rabbit Hole
After writing a ton about my [[PDW]] and [[Making an Obsidian Bullet Journal|Obsidian Bullet Journal]] recently. I decided to pry open [the main PDW library](https://github.com/aarongilly/pdw) and start tinkering. I spent 12+ hours chipping away at complexities, only to arrive at something that was ~5% less complicated. It all worked again, and worked *better*; but **I was left unsatisfied**.

So I started over. 

Only this time rather than trying to chip away what didn't feel necessary, I took a [zero-based budgeting](https://gillespedia.com/Zero-Based+Budgeting) approach and started with **nothing** then *added in* what absolutely had to be there. It is still in work, but seemingly coming out *dramatically* simpler. [Cardinality is always one of the most important architectural decisions](https://gillespedia.com/Cardinality+is+Always+One+of+the+Most+Important+Architectural+Decisions). I made a cardinality change, and everything[^1] is much simpler.

My key design philosophy this time around was to make the entire system as simple to explain as possible. **What is the fewest number of parts and rules I could use, while still retaining the essence of the project?** This is producing very promising-looking results[^2].

I might do another post on this at some point, might not. I know this topic is essentially me writing for me[^3]. 
# Finishing Ingredients 
A thing I have aged into, really getting pumped when we finish ingredients we have on hand. When we get to perfectly empty the container of (cheese, chicken, etc) for a recipe... oh boy that's a sure sign things are going according to plan. I just ate the last of the rice, chili, bacon, cheese, and sour cream all at once. Simple joys of life. 
# Infinite Firm + Illness
In [[459#Infinite Firm|Column 459]] I introduced my intention to transition from 75 Hard™️ to *Infinite Firm*. That was about a month ago. During that month every single member of my family has been sick with COVID, plus a couple of bonus mystery illnesses. So how's it going?

| Infinite Firm Daily Goals                   | Days Successfully Met |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| No alcohol on work nights                   | 24 of 24 work nights  |
| Drink a gallon of water, at least 1/2 plain | ~30 of 33 days        |
| Spend 30+ minutes outside every day         | ~30 of 33 days        |
| Work Out                                    | 21 of 28 healthy days |
| Intermittent Fasting                        | ~10 of 33 days        |
| Read a book or mediate for 10 minutes       | ~10 of 33 days        |
Those are arranged from most to least successful. The intermittent fasting thing surprised me somewhat. I've woken up hungry a lot. And the reading thing is simply because I'm dedicating all my "me" time to the PDW re-vamp. Overall I'm pretty pleased with my adherence.

# Top 5: Top-Level [[General Operating Principles]]
The list I've made & linked to just there is hierarchical. This is the top-most level of that hierarchy.
## 5. Use systems to manage your life
## 4. Keep it simple and focused
## 3. Bias toward action
## 2. Embrace the pain
## 1. Pay attention to what's important
## 0. Don't go it alone

[^0]: after writing this I added to the "Words" section
[^1]: so far.
[^2]: Let's see... I've got 2 dozen eggs here. So that's exactly 24 chickens coming soon!
[^3]: which is the stated goal of this whole blog, to be fair
