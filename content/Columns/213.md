I'm not going to link these next few, because they'll change too much and I'm tired of it.  

**A Really Good Vacation:**$500 - Four night cruise in the Bahamas (in 4 months) $500 - Second ticket $150 - Bus tickets to the port and back for two $350 - Money for on-board entertainment **A Good, Solo Vacation:**$1150 - Flight to Italy and back (in 4 months) $350 - To stay in Italy as long as possible **A BAD Vacation:**$1500 - Flight to Italy and back (in 2 1/2 months) $0 - Being homeless and alone in Italy for a week \*These lists were made using some of the most obvious Google searches I could think of. They are not idealized or comprehensive. They are definitely **_not_** the cheapest or best possible options for each thing. I generally picked the top reviewed item from whatever site, but that's hardly a replacement for **_actual_** research. Another note, I promise you most of these links will go dead within a few months - some will be dead by this time next week. So, at that point you'll just have to trust me.
