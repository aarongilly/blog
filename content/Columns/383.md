This Column exists *mostly* as a test of the new mail letter. Thanks to Google Plus shuttering its doors and my recent switch of hosting platform, I didn't really have a good way to automatically share new posts (outside of the RSS feed button for your favorite RSS feed reader). For my reader, I wanted to make sure you were well-accommodated.

I changed the "email me" link on the sidebar (or in the header under the "follow" button on mobile).

I am working on a long-ish post to end up the year. That's not this. Most of what I want to say is going to be in that. 

I'm working to improve my writing process. I don't mean "make the writing better"; I gave up on that a long time ago. I mean "make it *easier*". I'd like to make it easier to include drawings into these.
