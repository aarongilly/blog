# Bullet Journals
A bullet journal is a planner, journal, calendar, habit tracker, art book, and more all rolled up into a physical notebook. It's not a product, it's a *practice*. One that became more widely recognized around the start of the pandemic. I will overview them below, but encourage you to read [More about bullet journals]([https://bulletjournal.com](https://bulletjournal.com/)).
## Super Short Version
A bullet journal is a literal *journal*. A notebook you carry around with you and write in/reference throughout the day. The notebook can be *any* notebook, although [A5-sized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size) notebooks are most common. The notebook is not itself structured[^1], but it *becomes* structured as you use it. You create in your notebook one page at a time, using whatever the next available page is. What makes this a "system" is the use of the modules documented in the Top 5.
# Philosophy: Digital vs Physical
Ever since the invention of the computer[^2] there has been a choice to make when it comes to how you organize your information - digital or physical? 

What used to be a "little black book", 12 month calendar, letterbox, post-it notes, and scrapbook albums are now just apps on your phone. Since digital became an option, it's slowly evolved to become the *default* option. The Bullet Journal movement questions whether this is necessarily a good thing. It's not simply a luddite disdain for "new", longing for a return to some imagined "glory days of the past". It's an argument about what's genuinely *better* and better for you. 
## Physical
### Clarity
Bullet Journals benefit from [Desired Difficulty](https://gillespedia.com/Desired+Difficulty). Space on a page is limited. Physically writing things takes time. This forces you to **slow down**, consider what matters to you, and [Distill](https://gillespedia.com/Distillation) the [vital few](https://gillespedia.com/Pareto+Principle) into your system, disregarding the trivial many. This is a much better approach than capturing everything.
### Visuals
Pen on paper is also a very liberating way to externalize the mind. You aren't stuck working in the serialized world of typed text. My notebooks are filled with stars, doodles, circles and all forms of arrows & flowcharts.
### Durability
There are books in the world today that are *thousands* of years old. Meanwhile, papers I wrote less than a decade ago look all weird now when you open them in Word. Anything captured to paper will remain in that state forever - there's no concern of file formats becoming outdated. They aren't threatened by "the cloud" going down or hard drives dying. 
## Digital
All that said, there are also good, compelling reasons to prefer digital. 

I believe there's room for a happy medium - a *digital bullet journal*. 
### Obsidian as a Digital Bullet Journal
Here's where this Column got **so hyper-specific** I decided to move this content to its own dedicated page.

# Top 5: Bullet Journal Module Types
These are very utilitarian examples - most of the other examples you'll find online are much more pretty to look at. I'll include links to prettier examples.
### 5. Index
![[460-5.jpeg]]
The index is usually the first few pages. It's page numbers for [[#Collections]], [[#Monthly Logs]], and [[#Future Logs]]. Daily pages don't get indexed.

### 4. Future Logs
![[460-4.jpeg]]
A future log is typically a whole-year overview. A spread containing boxes for every month, in each month are big events and goals you have for the month.

### 3. Monthly Logs
![[460-3.jpeg]]
A monthly log is a list of the days of the month you're in and whatever important things need to happen on that day. Things like a party you're hosting, a doctor's appointment, important deadlines - or other such things that fall out of the standard daily/weekly routine.

### 2. Daily Logs/ Rapid Logging
![[460-2.jpeg]]
These take up the bulk of a "standard" Bullet Journal. They are a heading for a new day, and any little events, notes, observations, or tasks you pickup throughout the day. They are meant to be very economical in terms of letters written and info captured.

> [!success] Rapid log

> 	- ⭐️ Pack night before
### 1. Collections
![[460-1.jpeg]]
"Collections" are Ryder Carrol's catch-all term for "anything else". Common collections include:
- Trackers - habits, diet, workouts, books read, movies, etc
- Quotes you like
- Reference info about (whatever)
- Plans about an upcoming vacation
- Joke ideas

The idea is it that it's a spot designated for a type of thing that you might come back to or add to over time. Another name for "Collections" could have been "References and repositories".
