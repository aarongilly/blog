Motto: IN AND OUT  
  
This is going to be a super quick update before the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. midseason finale. I'm very excited for that.  
  
I'm very excited about everything right now. I'm really happy about my recent transition. Things are going better than I could have expected.   
  
I took part in a friend's biannual family Christmas bash last weekend. It was also great. It's so cool they do that. I aspire to be that cool.  
  
Weirdly almost every single card in my wallet is changing all at once for different reasons. My ID will stay the same... but that's about it. It's weird that several things that almost never change are all changing simultaneously for different reasons.
