Motto: Twitter sucks \#ProbablyJustJealous   
  
I don't have a Twitter. I don't like the idea of a stream of small text posts. So here's everything I would have tweeted if I had a Twitter:   
  
 Any pairing of "good" plus a time of day is either a hello or a goodbye. "Good afternoon" is different than "good night". \#RandomObservation   
  
 I'm drinking coffee. I'm in the bathroom. \#CircleOfLife   
  
 Roses are grey. Violets are grey. Everything is grey. I am a dog. \#HEGOTJOKES

 Mission Impossible 1 was good. Mission Impossible 2 was Mission Impossible 1\. Mission Impossibles 3 & 4 were Mission Impossible 2\.   
  
 I don't understand Twitter. Please everyone disregard the message intended for my wife. I love you all too, but, just... that wasn't for you   
  
 If Google buys Twitter you know he'll be wearing a Twitter T-Shirt on Monday. \#Brandist   
  
 Hello Chris Hardwick! I listen to your stuff! Thanks for making my commute less boring. Have on more superheros. I have narrow interests.   
  
 The person behind the checkout counter actually "checked me out". Thanks but no thanks. \#Standards \#Mirin   
  
 I miss Melissa.   
  
 Ant-Man: What a fun little movie. \#DadJokes \#DadJokesButReallyThatIsJustMyActualOpinionOfTheMovie   
  
 Revving your engine is for peacocks. Find ways to try to impress people that aren't so loud. I don't like you.   
  
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42   
  
Peptobismol should run a commercial where it is poured onto the surface of Jupiter, and it ceases being a Gas Giant. \#ThatsAStretch   
  
Abbreva should run a commercial where it is poured onto the surface of Jupiter, and its red spot goes away. \#StillStretching   
  
30 Day Challenge: Wake @ 6, Bed @ 10, Eat in, Drink water & coffee, run a mile, 100 pushups, 15 pullups, & 15 minutes stretching. Every day.   
  
Day 2: I'm so tired. I'm so, so very tired.   
  
The word "Alphabet" should really end with a "z".   
  
Day 6: Why am I DOING THIS? \#WHYAMIDOINGTHISQUESTIONMARK   
  
 You're fat because you eat too much. The proof is in the pudding. \#HESTILLGOTJOKES

# Top 5: Advantages with which I was Born   
5\. Tall, right-handed, right-eye dominant   
4\. Semi-atheletic build, propensity to lose weight rather than gain it - even into my late twenties   
3\. White male (sadly, this is still almost undeniably an advantage in America)   
2\. Typically functioning body & mind   
1\. My family & upbringing, a distinct & clear advantage
