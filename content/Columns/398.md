# Preamble

The things we use to shape our craft also shape our lives. We are a product of the toolset we choose, just as much as the creations we make with them. I think that's why [I've been interested in "EDC" culture for a long time](https://aarongilly.com/8/). I've spent a *lot* of time thinking about tools, looking at possession fetish sites ([Timbuk2's site](http://whatsinyourbag.com/), [/r/whatsinthebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsinthebag/), [/r/onebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/), and [/r/EDC](https://www.reddit.com/r/edc) all come to mind. 

## Why this Post Exists  
I use a lot of things for a lot of reasons. Some of my tools are indispensable, and some I use through gritted teeth. Now that I've built a central location *(/portfolio, I guess?)* to track [the things I create](https://www.notion.so/aarongilly/9e6c767be05a42c7ab438e4330658e2b), I thought it would be helpful to keep track of the tools I used to create them. This was **primarily** so that I could quickly recall which coding projects I used which frameworks/toolsets/libraries on, so that I could reuse my own work... but after putting together the list I realized it may be helpful to anyone interested.

# Final Words
I don't intend to keep this Column entry up-to-date with my current toolset. It's a snapshot as of 2020-09-12. I do plan, for the foreseeable future, to keep [the Notion page this Column was written in](https://www.notion.so/aarongilly/Tools-41615f02a1cf4f5e80f29261a5484579) up to date.

## De-Googling  
One thing you may notice is the group of Google-related services in the "Out-of-Use" section. Google has historically been a massive, massive part of my life ("Google" used to be one of the tags I'd use for Columns). As time has gone on, though, and as Google has grown - I no longer revere the company as some sort of [pseudo God](https://churchofgoogle.org/Proof_Google_Is_God.html) (trigger warning for any fundamentalist religious types, that link is very much meant as a joke). I've seen Google make too many mistakes...

### Airing of Grievances 
* I have had too many tools I liked using yanked out from under me
* Most Google services I've been interested in never lived up to their potential
* I've grown **sick to death** of saying "Okay Google"

Long story short - yeah Google is pretty great... but not infallible.

# Top 5: Digital Subscriptions I Currently Have
1. **Netflix** - $13/mo (standard) - it's Netflix. What are you going to do, **not** have Netflix?
2. **Spotify** Premium Family - $15/mo - simply the best music subscription service. Would be nice if they offered anything beyond "streaming audio content"... but it's a price we're willing to pay.
3. **Google One** - $10/mo for 2TB - this is essentially just Google Drive, but they wanted to make it sound like more than that.
3. **LastPass Family** - $4/mo - Password Manager. Very worth it.
4. **Glitch** - $8/mo - hosts my WebApps
**Pinecast** - $5/mo - hosts my Podcasts
**Notion** - $4/mo - hosts my notes & a lot of other stuff... although at this point they made the free version of it incredibly capable, paying isn't really necessary for the normal user
5. **Amazon Prime** - $10/mo (basically) - Amazon Prime is essentially a no-brainer for most of America. You could live pretty comfortably with ONLY an Amazon Prime subscription. They've got Prime Video (which has the best selection of kids shows), prime Music, a photo storage service, AND the free shipping. At this point I sort of see Amazon Prime's annual subscription cost sort of like "paying taxes", only instead of getting the privilege to have a military that protects us and a school system and whatnot, we get all the Amazon benefits. Same thing could be said of my Costco membership, but that's a different Top 5.

# Top 5: Digital Subscriptions I Don't Have, but Probably Should 
1. **HBO Max** - $15/mo - this streaming service is a direct competitor to Netflix, and its catalog is incredible.
2. **Dropbox** - $10/mo for 2TB - I use Google Drive, but man do I like Dropbox. It was my first introduction to "the cloud". Also their "Paper" online document editor, while not as robust as Google Docs, is satisfying to use. It's a shame that right now Google Drive is sufficing for everything I use - and more and more we're locked into it.
3. **Apple Arcade** - $5/mo - a subscription service that nets you access to a curated library of iPhone & iPad games, all of which are free from ads & microtransactions. When my kid gets older, this is 100% happening if it's still around.
4. **YouTube Premium** - $12/mo (single) or $18/mo (family) - YouTube without ads. YouTube downloads. Also Google's Spotify competitor "YouTube Music". If this wasn't nearly $20/mo we'd probably opt in. Also if Spotify wasn't so good. Also also if I weren't 80% confident Google will see a squirrel and drop this service entirely.
5. **The Hulu/Disney Plus/ESPN bundle** - $13/mo - Hulu and Disney Plus, what else could you want? Honestly with the inclusion of ESPN here, how does ANYONE have cable still? It's either lack of good internet or fear of change. There's **no** reason to not be a cord-cutter anymore.
