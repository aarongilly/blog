Motto: The Adventure Begins...  
  
Here's some notes-to-self from my Google Keep that I originally wrote with the intention of exploring at a greater length on here, but given that I write about this sort of crap all the time, I'm just going to write them verbatim from my notes:  
  
Always explore. Always try new things.  
  
Happiness is not that hard.  
Happiness follows healthiness. You feel healthy when you're exercising regularly, brushing your teeth, cooking nutritious meals and eating them, sleeping enough, and working on creating projects that hone talents and stimulate the brain.  
Happiness also follows a sense of control. You don't feel in control when you're giving into your "immediate gratification" impulses.   
  
Splitting your attention between things is a fleeting contentment that ultimately givesway to a sense of existential dread. It's always better to be fully into doing one thing than to be halfway doing two things.

 Okay that's done. Next up.  
  
I just found out I was born in the Chinese year of the Dragon. That's cool. Dragons are cool. Mythical creatures are cool. Refrigerators are cool, on the inside. I like the idea of folklore involving mythical creatures. Something about it I find very charming.  
  
Jessica Jones season 2 was okay. Jessica Jones season 1 is probably right behind The Punisher as my favorite of the Netflix Marvel series. Actually let's make this official:  
  
Aaron's official ranking of the Marvel Netflix series:  
1\. The Punisher  
2\. Jessica Jones S1  
3\. Daredevil S1  
4\. The Defenders

6\. Daredevil S2

That's how you pack.  
  
Top 5: Only Rules You Need to Play 8 Ball Billiards (a.k.a. "Regular Pool")  
5\. Players take turns shooting their balls (solids or stripes) until all their balls are pocketed; they then win the game by pocketing the 8 ball. Pocketing the 8 ball with any of their balls still on the table or pocketing any ball (or committing a foul) in the same shot as the 8 ball is pocketed is a loss.  
4\. All shots must be called by indicating which ball will go into which pocket (with no need for further specificity). This includes (but is not limited to) the 8 ball shot.   
3\. Your turn continues until you fail to make the shot you called or commit a foul.   
2\. Fouls include causing a ball to go off the table, not making contact with your ball first, failing to drive any ball into a pocket or a rail, or pocketing the cue ball.  
1\. All fouls result in ball-in-hand.
