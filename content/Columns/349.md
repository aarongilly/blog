Motto: Life, One Second a Time  
  
I had a kid. I'll write about that next time. It's tough to try to get everything I want to say about that together and typed and whatnot - so I'm going to postpone that one and throw out this one. I've got several Columns already in mind right now. Actually that gives me the Top 5 topic.   
  
  
[Here's the playlist of all of six videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8%5FAwZQKjplc&list=PLmlnPk8L9dSJM8HcSDsRFcjrVAGOUfPuw).  
  
I'm not writing any more on this topic. That video marked the end of the longest-running creative project I've ever done. This is a cathartic Column.  
  
Top 5: Titles of Columns that I've been Trying to Write for the Past Few Days  
5\. "Sixth Second-A-Day"  
4\. "Feature: Analysis of Human Attractiveness"  
3\. "Make Stuff"  
2\. "Self Help (Yourself)"  
1\. "Griffin"
