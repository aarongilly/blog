Motto: If you are listless, you lack energy or enthusiasm. Prepare for energy and enthusiasm.

  
There are several different ways people refer to me:

* Tall guy
* Goofy guy
* Really tall guy

But nobody ever says:

* Handsome guy
* Mr. Macho
* The Listmaker

... which is a shame. At least one of the three of those is dead-on accurate.

  
This Column is full of lists. Some of these lists will be from previous Columns, but I wanted to be thorough. Here's a list of the lists that you'll find if you decide to keep reading:

* Ways people tend to refer to me
* Ways people _should_ refer to me
* List of lists
* Big wedding details that Melissa and I have already taken care of
* List of television shows of which I've seen every episode
* List of phones I've owned
* List of consumer products I endorse
* List of the contents of my messenger bag
* Top 15: Life Pro Tips

Melissa and I have finally reached the point where I feel comfortable saying "we've got pretty much all the big stuff taken care of when it comes to our wedding." While we are still a long ways from done (we've got a lot to do in the next month), we can at least say we've taken care of the following:We've got all the biggest wedding details done. This includes:

* Date
* Time
* Wedding site
* Reception site
* Photographer
* Officiant
* Dress
* Tuxes
* Bridesmaids dresses
* Bridesmaids & groomsmen
* Immediate family outfits
* Rental crap
* Caterer
* Band
* Hotel
* Photobooth
* Party bus
* Cake
* Floral
* Makeup
* Hair (different from makeup somehow)
* Rings
* Honeymoon
* Flights
* Invitations
* RVSPs
* Save the Dates
* Website

There won't be many segways between these lists. I don't know how to transition from wedding details to television shows gracefully. Gracefully. _Will & Grace_. Here's a list of television shows of which I've seen every episode:

* _NOT_ Will & Grace - I just wanted to make that clear
* Scrubs
* Lost
* Breaking Bad
* Family Guy\*
* Futurama
* Modern Family\*
* Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\*
* Parks & Recreation\*
* The Office
* Brooklyn Nine-Nine\*
* Community\*

\* The six shows denoted with an asterisk are currently in production - but I've still seen every episode of them. I didn't realize I'm keeping current on 6 different shows. That seems excessive.

  
I have owned the following phones (listed from oldest to newest):

* Unnamed Motorola flip phone
* Motorola Droid
* HTZ Rezound (for 2 weeks)
* Galaxy Nexus
* Nexus 4
* Nexus 5

The following is a list of consumer products that I, Aaron Gillespie, publicly endorse:

  
* Nalgene
* Timbuk2 Bags
* Leatherman Multitools
* Casio G-Shock Watches
* Converse Shoes
* Papermate Flair Pens
* Moleskine Notebooks
* Google Services (all)
* Nexus Phones
* Boulevard Wheat Beer
* Rubber Duckies, any brand
* GoPro Cameras
* Pelican Cases
* KeePass & TrueCrypt Programs
* Dominion

That was basically the entirety of Column #142\. Thanks for rereading that.

  
The following is a complete list of the contents of my messenger bag (before I sat down at this table):

* Black Moleskine notebook
* Black Papermate Flair pen
* Black Sharpie
* Black Kensington 8GB flash drive
* Black Nexus 4 earbuds (these are a thing)
* Black earbud bag
* Black external batter/laser pointer
* My work ID
* Short microUSB cable (tied with gear tie)
* Long microUSB cable (tied with gear tie)
* USB outlet base
* Timbuk2 cross strap (tied with gear tie)
* Spare gear tie
* Nalgene
* Eye drops
* Cuticle nippers
* Toshiba Chromebook
* Streamlight flashlight
* Leatherman Fuse mutlitool
* And, because I'm not wearing shorts with pockets - my phone, wallet, & keys

That's enough. Here's the picture to go out on - secret extra list! (this list is out of date)
