Posts about the current state of the Column 1) are not interesting, and 2) do not age well... but here's one anyway!
# New Column
Hey! Things look different! 

Things actually probably look *worse*, if I had to guess what my average reader would think. But my previous codebase was essentially just a template I used verbatim. The new blog is *also* a template, sort of, but it's one that I can (and have) change to suit my fancy.
## Why
The move to the new code base allows me a ==less tedious== writing & posting process.
### Old Posting Process

### New Posting Process

## Why *Really*
I wanted *even more* ownership over my content & how it is presented. This new approach allows me to use [Obsidian](https://gillespedia.com/Obsidian), which has really started to replace Notion as my go-to app for where I want to spend a lot of my time. The new setup is essentially just a rehosting of my Obsidian Vault to the web + some customizations.

Also the old method made images particularly tedious to include in my posts. This disincentivized me to using many images. The new method makes images no big deal and therefore more likely to be included, which I want.

# Analysis Analysis
To quote the first five words of my green notebook[^1]:

> [!quote] I love flowcharts and lists

That pretty well sums up my particular flavor of nerdom. But it’s not that I love those particular tools & techniques, it’s what they are used for that I love - climbing up the [Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom](https://gillespedia.com/Data%2C+Information%2C+Knowledge%2C+Wisdom+Pyramid#Wisdom) pyramid.

You take raw data, analyze it, and learn information. You encode that information into a digestible form and in the process it becomes knowledge. You do this often enough in a particular realm, and you grow wisdom[^2].

The tools of this trade are anything that helps you analyze, synthesize, represent, and generally play with data/information. **Lists** and **flowcharts**, though, awesome as they are, are not the *totality* of things in this arena. 
## Techniques & Tooling
When it comes to analyzing data, synthesizing information, and encoding knowledge, there are a wide variety of tools & techniques that I use. Here's a cross section of my current go-tos[^3].

| Technique             | Main Tool         | Prospective |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Tabular data          | Excel             | SQL         |
| Charts & plots        | Excel PivotCharts | Tableau     |
| Textual data          | Obsidian          | Python      |
| Freeform drawing      | So many.          |             |
| Flowcharts & diagrams | DrawIO            |             |
| Systems modeling      | No “Main”         |             |
| Ontology editing      |                   | Protégé     |
| Graph data creation   |                   | Python      |

## A Tool’s Errand
I'd love something that could do a nominal job at each of these things. Or figure out a process that goes between them fairly seamlessly. I think I might just be re-inventing Jupyter notebooks in my thought experiment.

> [!tip] An Omni-tool
> A pipe dream.

Basically Notion's "Block with Properties" approach, but not strictly hierarchical. With a very robust visualization engine that supports two-way binding of properties to graphical elements in the rendered diagrams. My "[[Semantic Canvas]]" Obsidian Plug-in is probably approaching the very *beginnings* of this sort of thing, but Obsidian is wholly inept at tabular data - which is a huge aspect of my imagined system.

One major design flaw (I assume) is the “every block is just a file” approach. Databases exist for a reason. Obsidian blows me away with how fast it is, but 
# Top 5: Current Coding Projects
## 5. Omni-tool
See the section right above the Top 5. I'm not seriously looking at building this, but I needed a 5th thing to round out a "top 5".
## 4. Obsidian + PDW Connector
My [[PDW]] migrated from a particular *thing*, to be more of a modular *framework of things*. Obsidian could very easily be the data storage & presentation layers. I've not started actually writing this code, but I've figured out how I think it would work.
## 3. This Blog Move
This one is sort of *done* as of this posting. I did lots of massaging of data and built a couple of custom components for this blog move. 
## 2. Semantic Canvas 1.2
My Obsidian Plugin “Semantic Canvas” has been downloaded > 2000 times as of this writing. Some folks reached out and suggested new features, which spurred me to start developing them. 
## 1. Brief Mystery
My 2024 Holiday Puzzle box is titled “Brief Mystery”. It is coming along! The most fun to work on of the list, but also the one I’ve been touching the least.

[^1]: The green notebook is the 2nd oldest thing I own. It was shown in [[20|Column #20]], which gives you an idea how old it is.
[^2]: That’s the theory I’m operating under, anyway.
