# Reviewing 75 Hard
76 days ago I got a message from Melissa:

# 36 is an Interesting Number

36 is the first[^1] square triangle number. Meaning, it's the first number you can do this with:

![[459-1.png]]

It's also the sum of the first three cubes:

$$1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 36$$
It's a highly composite number, divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, & itself. 

36 degrees is 1/10th of a circle.

Oh also I’m 36 years old now. So. Cool.
