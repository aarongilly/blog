For literally years I lamented my [note-taking platform anxiety](https://aarongilly.com/258), until along came Notion and more or less destroyed the competition once and for all. Now I have a new related-but-different app choice anxiety problem. 

# Whiteboarding Apps

Whiteboarding apps are meant to mimic a large whiteboard. They let you draw, write, attach images and sticky notes freely on a 2-dimensional canvas. They are an invaluable asset in the hands of creative-types. Whereas note-taking is the diligent recording of facts and thoughts, whiteboarding is the freeform expression and development of **ideas**. There isn‚Äôt a de facto standard for whiteboarding - no clear champion against which all others must be judged. Instead there are a myriad of options, each coming with their own pros and cons. Standard features typically include an infinite canvas, realtime collaboration, intelligent diagramming, and robust support for freehand drawing, but there's large variation from app to app.

I‚Äôm looking at apps that allow for drawing, diagraming, and allowing ideas to come about naturally. **Specifically looking for something that best fills the void in Notion‚Äôs highly structured, linear form**; and there are a lot.

I‚Äôm going to do the work, so you don‚Äôt have to. What follows is a rundown of some of the competitors in this arena. I‚Äôm going to use them to explain their pros and cons, and illustrate their workflow with Notion to embed a drawing, open the drawing, modify it, and see the modification in Notion.

<aside>
Final note before we get started:  
Drawing = literally just drawing stuff with an Apple Pencil  
Diagramming = making flowcharts using text in shapes that can be freely repositioned
</aside>

## GoodNotes 5

GoodNotes 5 is the app I‚Äôve been using for this purpose for the past few years. It‚Äôs not intended as a ‚Äúwhiteboarding‚Äù app, instead it mimics a digital *notebook*. GoodNotes was designed to be the notebook you use when you‚Äôre attending class. It‚Äôs feature set is built around making the process of **note taking** as seamless and intuitive as possible - the fact that it *also* works as a blank canvas on which to sketch out ideas is sort of a happy accident. It works pretty well for that purpose, but leaves some things to be desired in a proper ‚Äúwhiteboarding‚Äù application.

## Freeform

Freeform is the reason this Column exists. I was happy making GoodNotes work until Apple debuted Freeform, their ‚Äúofficial‚Äù whiteboarding app. Freeform is baked into every iPhone, iPad, and Mac as of the latest software update. It‚Äôs got an infinite canvas that allows you to work in real time with others as simply as sending them a text. It‚Äôs got some really nice things about it, but also some annoyances.

## Excalidraw

Excalidraw is an open source, browser-based whiteboarding app with a hand-drawn look. Excalidraw is *awesome*. It is the one I *want* to use. I **love** the aesthetic it creates and several other tricks it has up its sleeve. You can save Excalidraw boards as standard image files (PNG or SVG), while also baking-in the data necessary to open them back up in Excalidraw and continue working on them. Collaboration is dead simple. I can send you a link to an excalidraw and you and I can be collaborating on it in real time *immediately*, **no sign up or sign in required**.  [It‚Äôs this easy](https://excalidraw.com/#json=76n9ryQ4Elr-yrbVyWbLA,js4y-II7lJFNzBLfJT-nsg). Also it‚Äôs open source and saves in non-proprietary plaintext formats; which means Excalidraw files will probably remain openable *forever*.

So why isn‚Äôt it the automatic winner?

Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs buggy‚Ä¶ and its UX on mobile is not fun. You can install it to your device as a Progressive Web App, but you can‚Äôt associate that app with the ‚Äú.excalidraw‚Äù filetype on iPad or iPhone. You have to open the app, then open the file from within in the app. More friction compared to the others on this list. Also - in **theory** it enjoys a native integration with Notion - in reality I find that integration is wholly unreliable and unusable.

## FigJam

FigJam is a product I was almost wholly unaware of before writing this Column. It‚Äôs from the creators of the design app ‚ÄúFigma‚Äù, and its designed to be *very* fun to use FigJam is worth the price I paid for doing this research. For a week after writing about it I was pretty sure FigJam was going to replace GoodNotes as my daily driver. For the purpose of this Column, let's pretend it did[^1]. 

<aside>
üëå FigJam is great.

</aside>

FigJam has the **best** Notion support (by far), the **best** feature set (**also** by far), and the **best** all-around user experience across desktop, iPad, and mobile.

![figma board](assets/430-5.jpg)

FigJam embeds in Notion can work in two ways - a full-blown FigJam embed allows you to scroll around on the whiteboard (but not edit it) and see changes happen in real time. Alternatively, you can choose to ‚Äúpaste as Preview‚Äù, which gives you a *snapshot* of whatever you pasted in that cannot be scrolled but CAN be updated to the most recent value by clicking ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù. both options provide a one-click access to open FigJam to the correct spot and start editing immediately. This is easily the best workflow.

## Miro

Miro is a paid app and suffers for it. They want you to subscribe to do all sorts of things - while I‚Äôm happy to pay for things, these things are available elsewhere for free. Miro looks to be pretty alright if you are to ‚Äúbuy in‚Äù to using their ecosystem‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm definitely not doing that.

The UI is too cluttered & distracts from your content. Their intended use cases don‚Äôt seem aligned with my own (individual wanting a simple whiteboard to embed into Notion). While they **do** offer native Notion embeds, I got so frustrated trying to make it work and gave up. So there‚Äôs no example board to be seen here.

## Other Apps

There are other options that I ruled out more quickly. Here‚Äôs an incomplete list:

![table of others](assets/430-6.jpg)

# Decision Matrix

A decision matrix (aka ‚ÄúPugh Matrix‚Äù aka a couple other names) is a tool to used to rank competing options in a rigorous and (supposedly) objective way. The general idea is you come up with criteria you care about, assign each of those criteria a weighting factor, score each of your options against each criteria, then finally multiply the scores received by the weighting factor and sum up the overall score to determine the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù choice. If that doesn't make sense, don't worry. There's an example below. 

## Decision Matrix Problems

My experience with decision matrices is that they aren't objective. They are just subjective in a slightly more rigorous way. They have many potential points of failure.

Your decision matrix might suck if:

- You fail to include all criteria you care about, or include unnecessary criteria that dilute what is actually important
- You and your collaborators don't agree on criteria, or criteria weighting
- You don't have an objective scoring system for each criteria & rely on opinions
- An option on the table solves your problem in a way that *just so happens* to not line up with your criteria

## Defending the Decision Matrix

So if a decision matrix is prone to failing in numerous ways, does that mean it‚Äôs useless? No. They can be helpful.

First, there are a number of mitigations you could put in place to make the scoring systems less subjective. You could use the wisdom of the crowds, or perhaps your situation lends itself to obvious criteria and objective metrics against which you can score each option without requiring judgment. 

Even if none of that works, just by putting in the work to think about and talk about what's important will *probably* give you the information you need in order to know what you *want* to win. Sometimes that's all you need.

# A Whiteboarding Decision Matrix

![a table of numbers](assets/430-7.png)

Options along the top, criteria along the side. Each criteria holds a weight factor, each option is ranked against each other option. The ‚Äúbest‚Äù option in each row gets the 10. The others are ranked relative to it. The score at the bottom of each column is the sum of the numbers in the column after they are multiplied by their corresponding weight factor. So, GoodNotes is a 10 in the ‚ÄúFun on iPad‚Äù criteria, which has a weighting of ‚Äú8‚Äù. So 8 x 10 = 80 points. Continue down each row and you end up with 380 points for GoodNotes. The other columns are scored in the same way.

Notes:
- All of those scores are subjective. Herein lies the myth that decision matrices are ‚Äúobjective‚Äù.
- GoodNotes means the app ‚ÄúGoodNotes 5‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt free‚Ä¶ but is a one time expense that I‚Äôve already paid, so continuing to use it for me is effectively free.

# Conclusion

I‚Äôm going to use FigJam[^2]. I already made that choice **before** doing the decision matrix, and the decision matrix reinforced that choice.

I am *also* going to keep Excalidraw in mind when I‚Äôm looking for something with a particular aesthetic - or if I‚Äôm wanting to actually do collaborative whiteboarding with someone remotely. I *adore* their ‚Äúno sign-in required, no install necessary‚Äù operating model, and the results end up looking very pleasing. I‚Äôm also probably going to use Excalidraw for any drawings or doodles I‚Äôd want to keep for posterity - say as part of my body of Notes. I love that the project is open-source and the files are simple JSON text files. I think a local install of Excalidraw is pretty future-proof. And if Excalidraw fixes a few bugs and get their Notion embed worked out - I might switch to it full time for everything.
