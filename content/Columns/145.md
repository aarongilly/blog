Motto: This Line Doesn't _Really_ Need to Be Here.

  
I was going to preface this post with an explanation of "thought experiments", but why reexplain the wheel?   
  
From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought%5Fexperiment):  
  
_A **thought experiment** or **Gedankenexperiment** (from [German](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German%5Flanguage "German language") considers some [hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis"), [theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory "Theory"),[\[1\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought%5Fexperiment#cite%5Fnote-1) or [principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle "Principle") for the purpose of thinking through its consequences. Given the structure of the experiment, it may or may not be possible to actually perform it, and, in the case that it is possible for it to be performed, there need be no intention of any kind to actually perform the experiment in question. The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question._  

Before I get into the content of my experiment - I want to give you a bit of background:   
  
I recently moved. Everytime you move, no matter how much stuff you have, you will inevitably think **"_why do I need all this crap?!?_"**.   
  
That question fits in line with a ton of themes from my life (see the quotes for a brief list) that combine to form a much more fundamental question:  
  
**"What are the bare essentials that you would actually have to have to live a comfortable, happy life."**   
  
Answering that question is my experiment. Note that the question is not "what are the bare essentials to _live._ This isn't a survival scenario-type question. What do you need to live out _your version_ of a happy life? Here's a brief version of my answer:

| A quick diagram I made, not representative of the list, but something to look at.                                                                                            |

  
* 1 small studio-type house, about the size of a railroad car
* 1 motor vehicle, parked in your house with everything else
* 1 toilet
   * Toilet paper & plunger
* 1 shower
   * Body and 2-in-1 hair soaps
   * 2 bath towels (I don't like using damp bath towels)
* 1 sink
   * Hand soap & towel
   * Dish soap & brush
* 1 oven/stove, one or two burners would be enough
* 1 refrigerator
   * 2 Nalgene bottles (so you can always have one in the fridge)
* 1 couch, on which you can sit _and_ sleep
* 1 desk, on which you can work _and_ eat
* 1 ottoman, to use for leg propping, sitting, and storage
* 1 small and 1 large version of the following:
   * Bowls, plates, glasses, Tupperware
* 1 large pan, pot, and baking tin
* 1 spoon, 1 fork, 1 knife
* 1 bicycle
* 1 messenger bag
* 2 pairs of pants
* 3 pairs of shorts
* 7 pairs of underwear
* 7 shirts
* 1 pair of boots
* 1 pair of running shoes
* 1 medium-to-high end laptop
* 1 external monitor, which doubles as your television
* 1 smartphone
* 1 multitool
* 1 box of GoPro-related stuff
* 1 box of medical supplies & toiletries
* 1 tool box
* 1 box of camping equipment (I like camping more than I let on)
* Ongoing gas, electric, water, internet, and smartphone connections

That is a slightly condensed version of the full list (which goes down into exact medical supplies and toiletries, tool box components, camping box components). It contains several things nobody really _needs_, but I'm confident it isn't missing anything I couldn't live without.
  
  
So, what are the things _you_ need to live the kind of life you want? Why do you have anything else?  
  
Top 5: Obvious Things I Could Leave Off My List

5\. One of the Nalgene bottles or bath towels  
4\. The bicycle or motor vehicle, depending upon where I'd live  
3\. The GoPro stuff. Nobody _needs_ a GoPro. But I really like making videos and I really like my GoPro.  
2\. The External Monitor.  
1\. Really, everything but the camping stuff. I could get by with that for a while.
