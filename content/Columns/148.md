Motto: When "Running to the Store" is Literally Possible

  
I've lived in five types of places in my life: 1\. In a small town 2\. In the country 3\. In a small city/big town 4\. In a big city 5\. In a suburb So far, I'm most a fan of the small city or the suburb. Rather than "write" a lot of subjective bologna about the difference between the different environments I've lived in, I'm going to present the case graphically:
  
  
| Table of Recreation   | Small Town | Country | Small City | Big City | Suburb |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| Park                  | X          | X       | X          | X        |        |
| Gym - weights         | X          | X       | X          |          |        |
| Gym - basketball      | X          | X       |            |          |        |
| Pool                  | X          | X       | X          | X        | X      |
| Pool I'd Actually Use | X          |         |            |          |        |
| Pool Table            | X          | X       |            |          |        |
| Bicycle Friendly      | X          | X       | X          | X        |        |

  
Top 5: **Specific Perks of This Suburb** 5\. Sits on the interstate I find most useful 4\. Excellent representation of places I like to eat/shop without an overwhelming amount of places I don't 3\. A source of potentially career-long employment 2\. 10 minutes to the Plaza. 10 minutes to Downtown 1\. The name lends itself to puns
