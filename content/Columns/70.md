# Motto: My health? It's gone viral.

I fell ill Monday night. At 8pm on Monday I decided I needed to go to bed because I was tired. Then I realized I was freezing. Then I realized I was sore everywhere. Then I swore silently to myself.

I had caught the flu. Or a virus. Or something.

Here's the timeline:
8pm, Monday - 8pm, Tuesday: Never left bed. Not to pee. Not at all.
8pm, Tuesday - 8am Wednesday: Used restroom. Refilled my water bottle. Moved from bed to couch because bed was COVERED in broken fever sweat.
8am, Wednesday - 8pm Wednesday: Forced a shower. Tried to work some, huge mistake. Fell back asleep for a few hours. Woke up again COVERED in broken fever sweat. Watched some Community.
8pm Wednesday - 8am Thursday: Ate some Greek Yogurt and a Clif bar - first food in >36 hours. Took meds for the first time (more on that in a second). Woke up, finally feeling most of the way better.

About the meds: Why did I wait so long to take them? The answer is that I experienced one or two delusional thoughts while I was down. One was that I didn't have any pills because they were all at my parent's house (which is not accurate) - the other was that I was leaving for Thailand today (literally today), instead of in 3 weeks. I believed both of those things so fully that I tried making phone calls. The phone didn't work, though. The touch screen wouldn't respond. I still don't know why - could be because it was also covered in sweat (capacitive touchscreens don't work so well when covered with a conductive substance) or it could be for some other reason that my 100+ degree brain couldn't comprehend. Either way, I successfully made neither of those calls.

I got a flu shot - yet I still got the flu. I'm pretty sure there's a lawsuit in there somewhere.

It was probably a virus, though.

Today is Pi day, 3.14. Today's date combined with the arbitrary way we line up dates in America bear a striking resemblance to the first 3 digits of the ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter. 

In high school, a couple of friends and I memorized Pi out to 50 something digits. This wasn't done out of pure boredom. It wasn't done with planning and forethought. One day, Josh found Pi written in a book as "3.14159". He remembered those extra three digits until the next morning when we saw each other again.

"Hey dude, did you know the next 3 digits of Pi are '159'?"

I did not. But I made a mental note to Google it, see if he was wrong, and memorize an additional digit on top of him.

He wasn't wrong. I memorized '2' - it actually should be a '3' with rounding, but I decided not to trifle with such frivolities. The next day in school -

"Hey, Josh, did you know the next digit of Pi is a 2? 3.141592".

And it was on.

Over the next month, we came into school each day having memorized another 2 to 4 additional digits of Pi. We made it just past the point I can remember to today:

3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399

You might be thinking "Aaron, any idiot can copy and paste something from the internet" - and you have every right to question me. But, if you do doubt, I ask you to write those 46 characters and ask me what they are the next time you see me.

Actually, since I like the number 47, I'm going to WORK on remembering that the next digit is a 3. Or maybe I'll remember 3751 and make it an even 50.

Here's the only picture I've taken since the last update to this one.

Top 5: Good things about having the flu
5. .
4. .
3. If you WANTED to lose weight, it would be helpful. I haven't weighed myself, but I'm betting I lost 3 to 5 pounds temporarily
2. .
1. I will have forcibly cleaned sheets thanks to all the sweat

Yes, I left off 5,4, and 2 on purpose. The flu sucks... and every time I write it I write "flue" and feel stupid. So it double-sucks.
