# Motto:  You know what I've noticed? Nobody panics when things go "according to plan." Even if the plan is horrifying!

The motto is a quote. Name the movie and get a prize (it's one of those fake internet prizes, so don't get your hopes up). The quote later on will not be a motto, though. Don't anticipate any sort of reciprocity there. It isn't happening.

Today I crossed something off my to-do list. Something that has been idling on there since before I graduated. If you've read the title of this post you probably already figured this out, but I've got that whole "job" situation lined out. Unless something weird happens, I will be starting work in September as a full-blown no foolin' Electrical Engineer. If you really care where, you can ask me in person. If you don't know me in person, then I don't care to tell you where I work. See how that works?

This brings up a strange and startling future reality: I'm going to have money. I will be making more money per unit time than I could feasibly spend by myself... even after taxes and retirement stuff is accounted for. 

The other strange and startling future reality: I'm going to have to work. I've taken a pretty extended vacation. Getting back into the swing of things at a job with responsibilities and whatnot is going to be a bit surreal. I'm not worried about it though. I'm pretty okay with stuff like that. 

From now until September 10th I'll be making final preparations for my employed life. This includes fabricating a good workout and diet plan. Financials. Uh... Other stuff too I guess.

I'll be at a gym 4 days a week. This bodes well for my "look like that swimmer guy" goal. You'll see. You'll see and you'll be like "dang". You're going to say dang. I'm calling that right now.

What am I talking about?

I should probably stop rambling and post a picture and call this column done. I'll go with one that is appropriate to mark the end of my long period of "I dunno what I'm going to do":

I've had 3 months off. Let's just say I have a few pictures saved on my computer that will make for great postings later on. You'll see.

# Top 5: Websites to waste extraordinary amounts of time
5. netflix.com <- obvious
4. stumbleupon.com <- born and bread to be a time waster... still not the best
3. wikipedia.org <- can cause problems if you find a particularly interesting tract
2. reddit.com <- surprisingly not my top pick
1. tvtropes.org <- every single time I've gone there, I haven't returned until many hours have passed
