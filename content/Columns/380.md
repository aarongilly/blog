It's been a while since I've written. I have had a lot of heavy trains of thought in that time. Daunting ones that would take a lot of time and energy to write about. Stuff like "time" and "energy". Instead of doing that, I'm going to make a simple, little list of good habits I wish I could do better.

# Good Habits I Suck At

- Break a sweat every day
- Meditate frequently
- Go for a walk
- Get out of bed early, and never snooze
- Making your bed in the morning
- Exercising in the morning
- Shutting off screens at least 2 hours before bed time
- Having a good, firm bedtime
- Eat vegetables every meal
- Practice an instrument
- Go for a bike ride
- Practice intentional gratitude
- Sketch things
- Follow a budget
- Read physical books
- Take online classes (and finish them)
- Go for a jog
- Get out of your comfort zone frequently
- Volunteering
- Engage in polite conversation with strangers
- Call your mom, ask her how her day is going
- Pray
- Leave your phone in a specific spot in your house, only use it if you go to that spot
- Clean up after yourself every place you go, everything you do, every time
- Take pride in your vehicle

By the way - that picture is from the website [Unsplash](http://www.unsplash.com), which is a really *really* neat website. It's basically a really great repository of actually *good* photos with a reuse license that basically just says "go nuts". Carte Blanche. I really get behind it, as a concept. It's a bit like open-source photography. Makes me want to get more into photography, actually. Seems like a good habit to get into... WAIT CONTINUATION OF MY LIST FROM ABOVE!

# Top 5: Good Habits I'm Actually Don't Suck At

1. Cable cutting... I just never had it to begin with. So this is cheating.
2. Keeping track of habits. I just fell into this one with my more broad goal to "keep track of life". Also it's not a perfect, exhaustive list of habits.
3. Doing something creative every so often. Like this. Even if it's not much.
4. Sleeping consistently enough hours. The hours I do move around a lot, but I do usually get 7 contiguous hours, provided my child sleeps well enough.
5. Talking with my spouse. A lot. About everything... I mean.... I think I'm good. I haven't asked her opinion on the matter.
