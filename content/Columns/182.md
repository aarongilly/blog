Motto: Matt Cutts

I've been lazy with the 30 Day Challenges lately. I'll admit that. But I have not given up on them entirely. They've definitely been in the back of my mind. With this post I'd like to start taking them more seriously again. Let's do a recap of how things are going so far: **January**  
**The goal:**Eat a Paleo diet & do CrossFit  
  
**How it went:**Way better than you'd expect.   
  
**What I learned:**  
I was too focused on "weightlifting" and not enough on actual _fitness_. Weightlifting is a huge part of fitness, but it's not everything - and I had forgot that.   
  
Also realized how much better I felt while eating paleo. I wasn't ever sickly feeling. Never gaseous. Never bloated. No "bathroom issues".  
  
Both of these experiences have had long-lasting effects. **February**  
**The goal:**Read 5 books  
**How it went:**I read 3 books. I picked a dumb month to do a quantity-based goal - February is short. Also I switched goals about 6 days in, which made it even shorter. Either way, I read 3 more books than I would have otherwise.  
  
**What I learned:**  
I should probably read from time-to-time, but I still don't prefer long-form reading as a leisure activity. I may pepper a book into my routine every now and again, but I'm definitely not going to be a habitual reader - which is a shame. **March**  
**The goal:**Write every day  
**How it went:**I wrote just about every day. It wasn't so much of a challenge, though. I write most days anyway. I put out a ton of Columns this month.   
  
**What I learned:**  
I realized just how outside-of-the-box you start to get when you force yourself to write every day. That type of writing is fun, honestly. **April**  
**The goal:**Run 50 miles  
**How it went:**Poorly. I ran 15 miles, almost all of which happened in the first week and a half.   
  
**What I learned:**  
Running much over a mile really flares up my back. Not good. **May**  
**The goal:**Enjoy yourself  
**How it went:**Really really well. I got married and went on my honeymoon. Resounding success, all around.  
  
**What I learned:**  
I didn't learn anything strictly because of this goal (although I learned a ton that month). This month was intentionally a cop-out. **June**  
**The goal:**Use a GoPro every day  
**How it went:**I used GoPros most days, but not every day.   
  
**What I learned:**  
Although I wanted to take better advantage of these awesome cameras I have, it's much harder to get a candid shot with a dedicated camera than it is with a cell phone camera... and I like candid shots.

_That brings us up to this month. I had planned on doing a "double down on fitness"-type goal, but instead I went with something a little more brain-related than body related..._

**July**  
**The goal:**Drop Windows, adopt Linux  
Goal 2 - use [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) every day to learn some Spanish  
**How it's going:**The original idea was to dual-boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu, then use only Ubuntu for the month. After which time I could decide between Linux and Windows for good... but I accidentally managed to factory reset my Windows machine. So that's not how it is going down. Luckily, I'm very much liking the new Linux-based system and wouldn't go back anyway.  
  
The Spanish part is going well. I actually enjoy it. Melissa seems to be enjoying it more. She's done twice as much as I have.   
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
How to use Linux and how to speak some Spanish. Also, that I enjoy both things.

_What about the future? I've got it all planned out..._

**August**  
**The goal:**No Reddit. (Also, Facebook, Google+, other such time-zappers. See what things I might do to fill out my free time without the usual distractions.)  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
Better things to do with my free time.  
**September**  
**The goal:**Work out 5 days a week... _before work_. Doing some pre-defined exercise routine (like 5/3/1, Strong Lifts, PHAT, etc)  
Part 2: Eat a macros-conscious diet  
Part 3: In bed by 10  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
Which parts of this routine are sustainable. How I feel living such a health-conscious life. This one is arguably more difficult than the Paleo + CrossFit one was.  
**October**  
**The goal:**Is a secret  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
Is also secret.  
**November**  
**The goal:**Spend no money (outside of bills and the groceries)  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
How much I can save, what things I can get away with _not_ spending money on, and how not eating out affects things.  
**December**  
**The goal:**Learn to music.  
  
**What I hope to learn:**  
To music.

-- Those are subject to change. I might combine some easy goals, change order, or just change things completely. I just wanted to get something on the books. You have to know what your goals are if you want to accomplish them. That's one of the cornerstones of management.  
  
And I should know, after all, I'm a manager..,,,,,,,,,,,,
