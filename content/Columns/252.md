Motto: Healthy Living, No Gimmicks  
  
GoPro makes one heck of a promotional video. Their newest "GoPro HERO4 Session" camera is tiny, but ultimately not compelling given the sacrifices it comes with. I'd say that's a shame, but thankfully I'm glad I don't want one.

I'm still doing 30 Day Challenges. **July** was to "Rewrite the Life Tracker". It was a complete success. I'm writing about August's challenge now because I don't want to muddy up my next update with 30 Day Challenge stuff. My next post will include my 3rd Second-A-Day video - "My 26th Year".  
  
August will be a busy month. Each day I will:  
* Run a mile
* 100 pushups
* 15 pullups
* Drink only water & coffee
* Eat in, eat up
* Bed at 10
* Wake at 6
* ...and my stretch goal: Stretching (for 15 minutes)

Summarizing all these things - August is going to be a "Month of Healthy Living Habits". They say the key to long-term success is to make little changes over time. I'm tired of that so I'm going to use the shotgun approach.
