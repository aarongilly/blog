# Motto: I Hate Writing about Writing. This Motto is Writing about Writing about Writing. Metametawriting.

So, those of you who come here often will notice it looks different... again. This is slightly more in-line with what I had in mind. It's still not perfect, but it's closer.

What I envision is less a "Blog" and more a multifaceted website, complete with many different sections (one of which would be a Blog).

Up above you'll find the Title of the page has been changed from "The Column" to "WVZ7X7". This is likely temporary. I am experimenting with the notion of "The Column" just being a portion of a larger entity, "WVZ7X7", which would also be home to videos, pictures, files, special articles, and other things of the sort. As you can see, I have already arranged spaces for Videos and Projects. The Videos page is built out, the Projects page is basically just a picture right now.

I'm bound by the format of the Column to put a picture somewhere around here, so here's that picture, without any context:
