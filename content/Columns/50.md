# Motto: Randall Munroe is my hero.

Yesterday I got stuck on the elevator in my building. I was trapped, alone in a 4x6 cell for 45 minutes. The worst part of it all: I had no cell service.

NO CELL SERVICE.

I had to THINK. I had to BE ALONE WITH MY THOUGHTS. I wasn't ENTERTAINED BY ANYTHING. I'm fairly sure it's the hardest thing anyone has ever had to go through ever.

Actually I made a video while I was in there. Just spent an hour clipping out some of the better parts. Here's the best 3 1/2 minutes:

(this video is lost to time)

Today I won $60 on a slot machine bet. I came out of the casino with all 60 of those dollars, too. If you watched that video before reading on, you'll already have known that.

I've been to a casino twice in my life now. Even when I actually win I don't like them. It feels... weird. Wrong.

The second thing I wanted to write about was pretentiousness. I have two stories to share of pretentiousness.

Pretentious-  (adjective) attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed. I don't use this word according to its exact definition, apparently, but you'll figure out what I mean by the word shortly.

Wednesday a lady asked me how tall I was (this happens often). I answered her. Her response irked me. Here's how it went:
Lady - "(swearword)! How tall are you?"
Me - "I'm 6'8" "
Lady - "Oh no, no way. My boy is 6'9" and you are definitely taller than him"
Me - "...alright..."

To me, what she said was pretentious. How self-important do you have to be to think that you know my height better than I do? You know, that thing that I have been asked about daily for years and years? You don't think I, a degree-holding engineer, haven't managed to accurately measure that?

You're son is lying to you. Probably others, too.

The second example is much older and much, much worse.

I took an acting class at KU (I was a film major for a year and a half). During this acting class, some big guru from high-up in the university came in to observe. He wanted someone to perform a monologue for him, so he could critique. The instructor picked me out to do my bit for this bigwig. 

I stood up, went to the front of the class, and introduced myself.

Me - "Hi, my name is Aaron and-"  
Guru (interrupting me) - "What was that? What's your name?"  
Me - "...Aaron"  
Guru - "How do you spell that?"  
Me - "A, A, R, O, N"  
Guru - "OH! You mean AARON."   
(I say "air in", he said "*aah ren*")  
The next thing he said -  
**"I just want you to know how to pronounce your own name correctly."**  

And that, my friends, is the most pretentious thing I've ever heard.

The next thing that happened was my instructor mouthed the word "no!" to me with a somewhat panicked look. Apparently I looked like I wanted to do this:

3. My best 3 goals: "Went on a friend date", "Brushed (x2)", and "Took care of my relationship"
