Fun ideas are fun. But first…

# Real Quick - What I've Been Up To

## PDW V10 👁

I have spent the past many weeks going all out on the version 10 **rewrite** of my Life Tracker, Lifeline Journal, Personal Data Warehouse thing. This one should be the last ever ground-up total rewrite. This one will be built with a forward-looking, modular architecture, and include capabilities for things like “having users other than me”[^1], and supporting robust data import and data export capabilities.

It’s actually already live, but I’ve hard-coded some user auth stuff - so no links just yet.

## Podcast Hiatus 🎙

My podcast went on an indefinite hiatus, which sucks. What would suck worse, though, would be forcing it to happen and no longer having fun with it. 

## Health Stuff ♥️

My back has decided I have had it too good for too long. See [Column #406](http://aarongilly.com/406/) for more information about this (and the PDW too, actually).

Okay onto the fun stuff.

# Custom Puzzles… 🗝

A thing I haven't written about before, but you might not be surprised by: 

**I like to make puzzles.** 

If you drive around any medium-to-large town, you're probably going to find one-to-several escape rooms. Their proliferation is evidence of their breakout success[^2] over the past ~10 years. The night after I first paid to be locked in an room for an hour I was doing research on their business plan. How much were they charging for a game, what percent of their games were full, how many employees would you need, et cetera. 

Puzzles combine creativity, engineering, art, cleverness, all into one fun project. If you make a puzzle for a group to solve, then you get social aspects into the mix & you've really got an all-around awesome thing. I'm bummed that there is only a good excuse to work on a puzzle once or twice a year. 

Every year since then I've made at least one puzzle per year for one event or another. When I get started with a new one, I get very excited about it, hypothesizing all sorts of things that I won't eventually have the time to do, that will be jettisoned in favor of making the holiday deadline. 

When we told our families were going to become parents, it came via a locked box with a second locked box chained to it. 

Then, when the holiday is done, the puzzle is gone. One and done, ephemeral fun. Which is a shame. I'd love to make more. I think I'm good at it. People seem to like doing them.

## …For Hire 💵

Then it hit me - I found the [intersection of aptitude, value, and affection](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEU6vqqM1LoJR9XMjb5PgbepkAZsAB33KN01iBlP8EaH8iNnEk2trCQqGOtSwdHIENdKPbAWgI-Dm04aeDec0ulUXyA6RfZXeN2H11_Z28BplE5Qkt9AiqcbX6p831j5yvio3QiGM5k6JW8mYyruSXk7Hw=w350). In short, something that simultaneously checks the boxes of being:

1. You’re good at
2. You enjoy doing
3. The market finds valuable

So! If you're reading this and you come to a point in your life where you want to make a puzzle for a birthday, holiday, work event, or whatever reason… send me an email. 

First person to do so gets a free custom puzzle to fit their needs.



# Top 5: My Skills that are Useful for Making Puzzles



## 5. Writing, Drawing, and Experience with Video & Audio Production

Push comes to shove, I can write decently well. [I enjoy constrained writing](https://aarongilly.com/160). Combine that with  I’m not horrible at drawing either, cartoons at least. I’ve made dozens of videos and over 100 podcasts.



## 4. Organizing Systems

Organization is required all endeavors of any legitimate size, Organization is critical when you’re building something as interdependent as a collection of clues & small puzzles to make something large. I apply systems engineering techniques to puzzle development. It’s very helpful.

## 3. Making

This is still a budding hobby… but given that I successfully designed and built the self-contained workbenches that house all my tools, I’m going to give myself a modicum of credit. If I had to make a box with a lid, I could do that. I’ve done woodworking on several puzzles thus far. I’ve got ideas involving full-blown making, though. Multi-media works. I’d like to do stuff with an Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 3D Printing things.



## 2. Coding

I can make websites[^3]. I can make web *apps*. Last Christmas the backbone of the puzzle was a custom website written with zero dependencies using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). Now I could turn out that same type of thing on any one of multiple web hosts in ~1/5th the time using [my own home-grown NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrapper-lib)… or I could stop being lazy/indecisive and commit to relearning React, or picking up Vue or Svelte and probably be way *way* faster.



## 1. The Ability to Focus

You really need to be — 🐿 OH LOOK!
