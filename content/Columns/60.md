# Motto: 6 Months Down, Six Months to Go

I have a lot of time to kill before I can put a wrap on this post. I just started the render for the updated version of my second-a-day video. This post is being created specifically to showcase the video because, as of this writing, I am exactly 24 1/2 years old... which means my video is exactly half finished. In an hour and twenty minutes, I'll upload it to YouTube. When that upload gets done (probably another hour, at least) I will put the video right below this line. For you, it's been there this whole time.

(this video lost to time)

This has truly been the longest I've ever worked on some project that was "just for fun". Unless you count skateboarding. I did that for 7 years. Some people are professional skateboarders after 2 years. Took me 7 to get somewhat competent. Skateboarding, though, is what introduced me to making videos. As you may know, all real skateboarders have to be on camera so they can be seen skateboarding; otherwise, what's the point, right? Putting together my first skateboard video started a chain of events that eventually led me to filming something every day for a year. This project was a relatively large undertaking when I started it. I didn't honestly think I'd be able to keep it up. But I have, and I'm glad. It's one of my favorite things I've ever made.

I think that video works best for me. Other people might like it... but I'm the only person who knows the other people in it, who went through the events documented, who has the memories. Everyone should do something like this. It's fantastic what you do in half a year.

I'm not sure if that was at all interesting to anyone. But that's okay because I did it for me. Most of this blog is done for my own amusement, anyway.

In other news, I had a highly productive day and I celebrated by eating a whole Digiorno pizza.

Did you catch my movie/tv show/song/book reference? I like hiding these things in plain sight. If you didn't spot it, this link is to YouTube and should give you the answer.

Because I want a picture to show up on the mobile version of the column, I need to post one. Here's the picture I sent to Melissa when I first tried on my usher's shirt and tie for Amy's wedding:
